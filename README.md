# Matrix Inversion using LU Decomposition

This Java program reads a matrix from a CSV file or generates a random matrix, performs LU decomposition, and finds its inverse. The implementation demonstrates key linear algebra techniques, such as LU decomposition, forward substitution, and backward substitution.

## Features

- **Matrix Generation**: Generate a random matrix or read from a CSV file.
- **LU Decomposition**: Decompose the matrix into lower and upper triangular matrices.
- **Matrix Inversion**: Find the inverse of the matrix using forward and backward substitution.
- **Matrix Printing**: Print the original and the inverted matrices.

## Usage

1. **Generate a random matrix**:
    - The program will generate a random matrix with specified dimensions and find its inverse.

2. **Read a matrix from a CSV file**:
    - The program will read a matrix from a CSV file and find its inverse.

## Running the Program

1. **Compile the program**:
    ```sh
    javac Snippet.java
    ```

2. **Run the program**:
    ```sh
    java Snippet
    ```
